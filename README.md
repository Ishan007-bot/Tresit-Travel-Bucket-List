## 🎮 Usage

### Adding Countries to Your Travel List
1. Browse countries on the home page
2. Click on "View Details" to see more information about a country
3. Set your travel status (Wishlist, Planning, Booked, or Visited)
4. Add optional notes about your travel plans

2. Filter your destinations by status
3. View your travel statistics and visualizations
4. Edit or remove destinations as needed

## 🏗️ Architecture

Tresit follows a component-based architecture using React. It uses Context API for state management, and implements a service layer for API interactions.

### State Management
- `TravelContext`: Manages saved destinations and travel plans
- `ThemeContext`: Handles theme preferences (dark/light mode)
- `AuthContext`: Manages user authentication state

### Data Flow
1. API requests are made through service functions
2. Services return data to components or contexts
3. Components render data from context or local state
4. User interactions trigger context updates

## 🔨 Technologies Used

### Core
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - UI library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - Routing
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool and development server

### State Management
- React Context API - Global state management

### Data Visualization
- [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) - Charts and data visualization

### Networking
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - HTTP client

### Optimization
- Code-splitting with React.lazy
- Image lazy loading
- Service Worker for caching and offline support

### APIs
- [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) - Country data
- Optional: [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - Authentication and database

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

Tresit implements several performance optimizations:

- **Code Splitting**: Routes are loaded lazily with React.lazy and Suspense to reduce initial bundle size
- **Image Optimization**: Images are lazy-loaded using IntersectionObserver for better performance
- **Memoization**: Components use React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Service Worker**: Assets are cached for faster loading and offline support
- **Mock Data Fallback**: Local data is used when API is unavailable
- **CSS Animations**: Hardware-accelerated animations for smooth transitions

## 🚢 Deployment

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory.

### Deployment Options

- **Netlify**: Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify for automatic deployments
- **Vercel**: Similar to Netlify, provides easy deployments from Git repositories
- **Firebase Hosting**: Good option if you're also using Firebase for backend
